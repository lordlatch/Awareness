Awareness 'book' to supplement <https://x.com/LatchPrime>

To explain some concepts I talk about on X (twitter), I wanted a free
non twitter blog or something.

I settled on a Bookdown book on a Github page. I didn't need all the
features and overhead a blog provides.

<https://lordlatch.github.io/Awareness/>

Easy and clean.

Any XRP it receives will be given away to someone unconnected to me.

If you give to it,

you will blessing a stranger of my choosing and affirming that

I am The Decider.
