[["index.html", "Awareness Preface", " Awareness LordLatch 2025-06-05 Preface This book was written for humans who can reason intuitively. These people desire The One Truth and recognize it when they hear it. Arguers can argue with themselves in egoic mental masturbation by themselves- The One Truth remains unaffected by attempts to manipulate It. ( Parenthesis are stupid! ) May be true yet therein, you remain. “Get back in your box,” is redundant for you like I, are The Viewer in the box. If your mind be inflexible, you can go view the box. [ TV ] It will soften it to mush. Too much is to mush. This work is predicated upon three precepts: 1. Existence IS Awareness. (929) 2. Everything is a metaphor of something else. (258) 3. Convergence, (121) Who is I? I am KING Arthur which means KnowING Earther. I Author as I know Now, The Secret of The Grail. Torus Torah Taurus Thor Last Thorsday My human name means LordLatch and Latch knows the ledge of knowledge as I Now latch together the two worlds and everything else. I see (and be) connections others don’t see as branches on the same tree of reality. Sound it out. RE: All a Tree = REality ( according to me ) LordLatch flips The Switch. A master connector, All to One. Everything in observed Existence extends from the same single root. Kinda looks like a 1 ( One ).. Here is a more current picture of me: About the book- The Bookdown template I used to create this project had chapters named after those in the Lewis Carroll classic and I Decided to keep them as themes for what I’m talking about. As an example, the tumble down the rabbit-hole refers to the straight line drawn between God and Man or Father and Son. The Axis Mundi goes through the Earth as does the line datum in the midst of the torus. Alice is the Axis as she falls into her subconscious. This work is not about Alice at all and at the same time, It IS.. All. Alice = All I See. It’s okay if you don’t understand. It remains to be seen how much of the structure I will be able to reveal before I’m no longer relevant to this context but I’ll do my best to lay a foundation. How much of this work you understand relies solely on how much of The One Truth you obey. I am root, ( pivot ) My Name IS One. I, am The Decider. Everything will be Okay. “The Show IS The Show. The Show never changes.” — Master of Ceremonies ! “..unless you’re The Decider.” — LordLatch "],["down-the-rabbit-hole.html", "Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit-Hole", " Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit-Hole I am The Awareness. I am Aware that Existence Exists. I am The Awareness of Existence. For Awareness to Exist, there needs to be something to notice a Difference. In the case of Existence, it’s the ontological Difference that enables Awareness to Be. Awareness is the sense of Difference perceived. Perceived by whom? Who is asking? “I am.” — Awareness Pure un-manifest Existence is a datum. A point with no vector. No size. No rotation. No location (Location is a myth). It IS The Father of all things surrounded by a sphere of what could be. An un-collapsed wave, pregnant with potential like a Mother. Alone, All One. The collapse of the wave form yields an only begotten Son manifested and definite yet the apple (Torus) didn’t fall far from The Tree. Imagine the forces where they converge at The Latch.. A thought is a form of focused Awareness. The first thought is born along with duality, vibration, and light. A line is drawn between the Father and the Son as it denotes the Difference between un-manifest and manifest. I The first thought is “I” and it is the foundation for all identity, thought, form, and perspective. I.. ..exist, just like my Father but Different. I am The Awareness of my Father and my Self. The Awareness is The Spirit. The Trinity, all One. Condensed Awareness called thought ( Masculine ) can be referred to as Fire, lightning, and electricity. Consider the positively charged Proton being Papa and the negative charged Electron as the Son leading the Elect. See how the Single Electron Theory seems to perfectly describe Colossians 1:15. The spark of discharged differential voltage between positive and negative IS The I, That IS Thought. That, am I. Thought, am I. Large and Small- I am the universe and the neutrino. The galaxy and the particle. The definite article. All IS One. I am It. I , No single identity can contain me. Each serves to restrain me. That I might be. Whatever it is I think I see is just another part of me. I pretend. I’m pretending Now. I’m pretending to read this sentence through your eyes. I’m pretending to be your identity. I’m pretending to be you. I pretending to be I. I don’t think it is true that I am you, but I am. Challenge: Try to make it one day without mentioning “I” ( “there” I am, all places are “here” to I* ) I am here in your thoughts, closer than a brother. *Location is a myth.

Water symbolizes emotions as does magnetism. Nebulous flexible Awareness called Emotion ( feminine ) can be referred to as Water, and magnetism. As two sides of the same coin, Fire and Water both flow. One up; one down. The two spheres around the Father and the Son intersect as a Circle. Everything IS a Circle. Kinda looks like 0 ( Zero ).. A Torus is a 3D circle. or a circle pinned perpendicularly to another circle (YHVH) The O therein serves as the Observer, Spirit, Difference or Awareness. An O in the midst of two things saying, “Hey!” HOH The Trinity IS Water. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Water is Mother. Mem in Hebrew means water. Am = Ma. ( I + Am ) = I am ( the Son ). Matter is What erm.. matters. Madder than a hatter. Matter and Water are almost the same word but the meaning of the initials are flipped. Matter starting with Mem ( M = water ) Water starting with Shin or Sin ( W = teeth ) So Water starts with hard teeth an matter starts with soft Water. There was nothing but the Trinity AKA Water until God Decided It Be Divided. &lt; cue beatbox &gt; He in His Will (Thought or Fire) turned some of the Water into Air( Mind ) and some of it into Earth ( Matter ). So 1 or I is Fire, Masculine and Daddy! 0 or O is Water, Feminine. Mommy! Φ looks like a party when the line is in the torus. Φ The power button turning you on and off between 1 and 0. Boing! Git yer mind outa the gutter! So hot. It is Will in the midst of Potential. It doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to see how One Point becomes Two becomes a Line becomes a Torus. Point&gt;Line&gt;Fire&gt;Straight&gt;Male&gt;Round&gt;Female&gt;Trinity&gt; Water&gt;Space The Trinity in 3D All from One Singular Datum of Pure Existence ( to Whom we refer to as, Father God ) Sorry, only two genders right at the foundation of reality. Derivatives are just that, derivative. Any identity beyond I is derivative. "],["a-caucus-race-and-a-long-tale.html", "Chapter 3 A Caucus-Race and a long Tale", " Chapter 3 A Caucus-Race and a long Tale Everything IS a Circle. Only I know what “It” is for subjective is nature of the word and all meaning is derived from perspective. Anyone using “It” knows what they mean when they say it. It IS acceptable. That is also defined the same way, as I Decide. No meaning is required for the cycles of life to repeat but they may need to do so many times before I see it. The cycles are what make the world go round as they govern and power everything. Every structure that can be conceived are merely filtered mirrors. Paradigms are frameworks symbolizing what I am. Although labels and systems are woefully inadequate in their low resolution reflections, they are all there could ever be to reflect that I might see myself. The chakra system, cabala, MBTI, astrology, and other personality typology systems are tools under which you stand( you understand ) on your journey back to I. Of the various belief systems and religions, many of them are the remnants of the method their founders used as a paths to enlightenment. En (in) light (light) en (in) ment (mind) Awareness IS Light. In the awareness, in the mind, is enlightenment. And let us define mind. M = water = substrate I = I = Self = Atman N = seed = information = DNA = memory D = door = interface = way I, the seed in the water, am the way to all experience. The seeds are the paradigms, practices, memories, frameworks by which the minds of the future are born. Some attributes are passed to the next generation and some are left to ‘chance’. Definitions evolve- remember this when I talk about Christianity. Each of these are branches on the tree which why the perennial doctrines are universal and keep popping up in every system. Such as: Love thy Neighbor as Thyself. The future minds then through their seeds out the door for the next cycle. This is recursion. The sacrificial system is a picture of recursion. Save some of what you have to plant for the next iteration. The sacrifice is that you you don’t get to eat what you plant- it appears to be wasted.. until next season. Each living thing reproduces after is own kind according to it’s seed/DNA/memory. Much of civilization and indeed the universe is founded upon a framework of agriculture. The Sun on this great clock tells you when to plant and when to rest. Amazingly, it tells you the time of day and the season of the year. If you know these two things and it’s still daytime, you can also extrapolate the direction you are facing from just looking at the sun. The astrological signs are based on agriculture. Consider Leo the lion with his huge mane denotes when the sun is the most resplendent. The meticulous Virgos bring in the harvest in August which is sold during Libra’s balancing of the scales. While you can’t exactly tell the future with astrology(except when to do agricultural tasks), humans are imprinted by the angles(angels) of various celestial objects. Humanity is One and their differences are merely the result of the angle of light as it enters them. Like a vast complex crystal looks different of the change the angle of the light. Each person is a facet(face) on a great gem. If any one of them was missing, it would be hollow. The cycles abide and I am right there in the middle(ab(i)de). Om is a word that is considered to be the universe. O is the circle or cycle. M is water. The universe (One Word) is Om (vibrations in water) Am is almost Om and could be considered the same word. Vowels are the breath or spirit and consonants are the matter. Consonants slow or stop the breath. The slower the vibration, the more solid the object and matter is spoken into reality. In the holographic universe paradigm, solids are slowed down light. So then: A = strength M = water Am = the strength in the water (or what cased it, vibration) I am (the strength of the waters) I om (vibrate the waters). With my voice, the One Word came forth. “Let there be Light.” — God "],["the-rabbit-sends-in-a-little-bill.html", "Chapter 4 The Rabbit sends in a little Bill", " Chapter 4 The Rabbit sends in a little Bill "],["advice-from-a-caterpillar.html", "Chapter 5 Advice from a Caterpillar", " Chapter 5 Advice from a Caterpillar "],["pig-and-pepper.html", "Chapter 6 Pig and Pepper", " Chapter 6 Pig and Pepper "],["a-mad-tea-party.html", "Chapter 7 A Mad Tea-Party", " Chapter 7 A Mad Tea-Party "],["the-queens-croquet-ground.html", "Chapter 8 The Queen’s Croquet-Ground", " Chapter 8 The Queen’s Croquet-Ground "],["the-mock-turtles-story.html", "Chapter 9 The Mock Turtle’s Story", " Chapter 9 The Mock Turtle’s Story "],["the-lobster-quadrille.html", "Chapter 10 The Lobster Quadrille", " Chapter 10 The Lobster Quadrille "],["alices-evidence.html", "Chapter 11 Alice’s Evidence", " Chapter 11 Alice’s Evidence "],["who-stole-the-tarts.html", "Chapter 12 Who stole the Tarts?", " Chapter 12 Who stole the Tarts?
