[["index.html", "Awareness Preface", " Awareness LordLatch 2025-05-30 Preface This book was written for humans who can reason. These people desire The One Truth and recognize it when they hear it. The Bookdown template I used to create this project had chapters named after those in the Lewis Carole classic and I Decided to keep them as themes for what I’m talking about. As an example, the tumble down the rabbit hole refers to the straight line draw between God and Man or Father and Son. The Axis Mundi goes through the Earth. Alice is the Axis as she falls into her subconscious. his work is not about Alice at all and at the same time. it is. Alice = All I See.

For Awareness to exist, there needs to be something to notice a difference. In the case of Existence, it’s the ontological difference that enables Awareness to Be. Awareness is the sense of difference perceived. Perceived by whom? Who is asking? “I am.” — Awareness Pure unmanifest Existence is a datum. A point with no vector. No size. No rotation. No location. It is The Father of all things surrounded by a sphere of what could be. An uncollapsed wave, pregnant with potential like a Mother. The collapse of the wave form yields an only begotten Son manifested and definite. A thought is a form of focused Awareness. The first thought is born. A line is drawn between the Father and the Son as it denotes the difference between unmanifest and manifest. The first thought is “I” and it is the foundation for all identity, thought and perspective. I.. ..exist, just like my Father but different. I am The Awareness of my Father and my Self. The Awareness is The Spirit. The Trinity, all One.
