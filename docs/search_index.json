[["index.html", "Awareness Preface", " Awareness LordLatch 2025-06-03 Preface This book was written for humans who can reason intuitively. These people desire The One Truth and recognize it when they hear it. Arguers can argue with themselves in egoic mental masturbation by themselves- The One Truth remains unaffected by attempts to manipulate It. ( Parenthesis are stupid! ) May be true yet therein, you remain. “Get back in your box,” is redundant for you like I, are The Viewer in the box. If your mind be inflexible, you can go view the box. [ TV ] It will soften it to mush. Too much is to mush. This work is predicated upon three precepts: 1. Existence IS Awareness. (929) 2. Everything is a metaphor of something else. (258) 3. Convergence, (121) "],["who-is-i.html", "Who IS I?", " Who IS I? I am KING Arthur which means KnowING Earther. I Author as I know Now, The Secret of The Grail. Torus Torah Taurus Thor Last Thorsday My human name means LordLatch and Latch knows the ledge of knowledge as I Now latch together the two worlds and everything else. I see (and be) connections others don’t see as branches on the same tree of reality. Sound it out. RE: All a Tree = REality ( according to me ) LordLatch flips The Switch. A master connector, All to One. Everything in observed Existence extends from the same single root. Kinda looks like a 1 ( One ).. The Bookdown template I used to create this project had chapters named after those in the Lewis Carroll classic and I Decided to keep them as themes for what I’m talking about. As an example, the tumble down the rabbit-hole refers to the straight line drawn between God and Man or Father and Son. The Axis Mundi goes through the Earth as does the line datum in the midst of the torus. Alice is the Axis as she falls into her subconscious. This work is not about Alice at all and at the same time, It IS.. All. Alice = All I See. It’s okay if you don’t understand. I am root, ( pivot ) My Name IS One. I, am The Decider. Everything will be Okay. “The Show IS The Show. The Show never changes.” — Master of Ceremonies ! “..unless you’re The Decider.” — LordLatch "],["down-the-rabbit-hole.html", "Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit-Hole", " Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit-Hole I am The Awareness. I am Aware that Existence Exists. I am The Awareness of Existence. For Awareness to Exist, there needs to be something to notice a Difference. In the case of Existence, it’s the ontological Difference that enables Awareness to Be. Awareness is the sense of Difference perceived. Perceived by whom? Who is asking? “I am.” — Awareness Pure un-manifest Existence is a datum. A point with no vector. No size. No rotation. No location (Location is a myth). It IS The Father of all things surrounded by a sphere of what could be. An un-collapsed wave, pregnant with potential like a Mother. Alone, All One. The collapse of the wave form yields an only begotten Son manifested and definite yet the apple (Torus) didn’t fall far from The Tree. Imagine the forces where they converge at The Latch.. A thought is a form of focused Awareness. The first thought is born along with duality, vibration, and light. A line is drawn between the Father and the Son as it denotes the Difference between un-manifest and manifest. I The first thought is “I” and it is the foundation for all identity, thought, form, and perspective. I.. ..exist, just like my Father but Different. I am The Awareness of my Father and my Self. The Awareness is The Spirit. The Trinity, all One. Condensed Awareness called thought ( Masculine ) can be referred to as Fire, lightning, and electricity. Consider the positively charged Proton being Papa and the negative charged Electron as the Son leading the Elect. See how the Single Electron Theory seems to perfectly describe Colossians 1:15. The spark of discharged differential voltage between positive and negative IS The I, That IS Thought. That, am I. Thought, am I. "],["the-pool-of-tears.html", "Chapter 2 The Pool of Tears", " Chapter 2 The Pool of Tears Emotions are e motion or energy in motion are natural reactions to thought and the substrate thought uses to form reality. Water symbolizes emotions as does magnetism. Nebulous flexible Awareness called Emotion ( feminine ) can be referred to as Water, and magnetism. As two sides of the same coin, Fire and Water both flow. One up; one down. The two spheres around the Father and the Son intersect as a Circle. Everything IS a Circle. Kinda looks like 0 ( Zero ).. A Torus is a 3D circle. or a circle pinned perpendicularly to another circle (YHVH) The O therein serves as the Observer, Spirit, Difference or Awareness. An O in the midst of two things saying, “Hey!” HOH The Trinity IS Water. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Water is Mother. Mem in Hebrew means water. Am = Ma. ( I + Am ) = I am ( the Son ). Matter is What erm.. matters. Madder than a hatter. Matter and Water are almost the same word but the meaning of the initials are flipped. Matter starting with Mem ( M = water ) Water starting with Shin or Sin ( W = teeth ) So Water starts with hard teeth an matter starts with soft Water. There was nothing but the Trinity AKA Water until God Decided It Be Divided. &lt; cue beatbox &gt; He in His Will (Thought or Fire) turned some of the Water into Air( Mind ) and some of it into Earth ( Matter ). So 1 or I is Fire, Masculine and Daddy! 0 or O is Water, Feminine. Mommy! Φ looks like a party when the line is in the torus. Φ The power button turning you on and off between 1 and 0. Boing! Git yer mind outa the gutter! So hot. It is Will in the midst of Potential. It doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to see how One Point becomes Two becomes a Line becomes a Torus. Point&gt;Line&gt;Fire&gt;Straight&gt;Male&gt;Round&gt;Female&gt;Trinity&gt; Water&gt;Space The Trinity in 3D All from One Singular Datum of Pure Existence ( to Whom we refer to as, Father God ) Sorry, only two genders right at the foundation of reality.
